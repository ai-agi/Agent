# _Large Language Models Based Autonomous Agent: A Survey_

## **Large Language Model Based Agent**

### 1. The Core Differences and Characteristics Between LLM-based AI agents and Traditional AI Agents

* [2023/09/23] An In-depth Survey of Large Language Model-based Artificial Intelligence Agents. _Pengyu Zhao et al_. `arXiv`. [\[pdf\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14365.pdf) [\[code\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14365.pdf)
  * This work explored the core differences and characteristics between LLM-based AI agents and traditional AI agents.

### 2. The behavior and personality of LLM agents

* [2023/09/14] The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents: A Survey. _Xi, Zhiheng, et al_. `arXiv`. [\[pdf\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07864.pdf) [\[code\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07864.pdf)
  * This work presented a general framework for LLM-based agents, comprising three main components: brain, perception, and action, and the framework can be tailored for different applications. Thus they explored the behavior and personality of LLM agents, thereby discussing the insights they provide into human society.

### 3. A LLM-powered agent that leverages LLMs to connect various AI models to solve AI tasks

* [2023/03/30] HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in Hugging Face. _Shen, Yongliang, et al_. `arXiv`. [\[pdf\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17580.pdf) [\[code\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17580.pdf)
  * This work advocated that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks, with language serving as a generic interface to empower this.
