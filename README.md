# _Large Language Models Based Autonomous Agent: A Survey_

## **Large Language Model Based Agent**

### 1. The Core Differences and Characteristics Between LLM-based AI agents and Traditional AI Agents

* [2023/09/23] An In-depth Survey of Large Language Model-based Artificial Intelligence Agents. _Pengyu Zhao et al_. `arXiv`. [\[pdf\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14365.pdf) [\[code\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14365.pdf)
  * This work explored the core differences and characteristics between LLM-based AI agents and traditional AI agents.

### 2. The behavior and personality of LLM agents

* [2023/09/14] The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents: A Survey. _Xi Z, Chen W, Guo X, et al._. `arXiv`. [\[pdf\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07864.pdf) [\[code\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07864.pdf)
  * This work presented a general framework for LLM-based agents, comprising three main components: brain, perception, and action, and the framework can be tailored for different applications. Thus they explored the behavior and personality of LLM agents, thereby discussing the insights they provide into human society.
